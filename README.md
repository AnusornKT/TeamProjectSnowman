# TeamProject: Snowman game
Our team has now created an interactive snow building game that anyone can play, and is fun for all ages. This Snowman Build is a fun, entertaining, easy catch game that will keep you entertained during the winter months, and playing in the snow from the comfort of your warm home. Help your snowman build itself by catching snowballs and build counting and competitive skills using a fun character. Kids will love it because of the character and because it is simple, fun, and playful, and adults will love it because it will keep you entertained with memories of playing in the snow.

# Introduction
The game consists of falling snowflakes along with an initial ball of snow. The player will have to catch snowflakes in order to build the rest of the snowman, adding to that initial ball of snow. The more snowflakes you collect the bigger the snowman becomes.
